 <!-- Help text for Shiny app STEMviz. -->

<div style="font-size:17px;">

This is STEMviz, a <a href='https://shiny.rstudio.com/' target='blank'>Shiny</a> web app written in the <a href='https://www.r-project.org/' target='blank'>R programming language</a>. It was designed to help visualize various aspects of topics taught in STEM courses.<br><br>

The app produces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map" target='blank'>heatmaps</a> with data contained in a Google Sheet, using the R package <a href="https://rlbarter.github.io/superheat/" target='blank'>superheat</a>. See also <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01524.pdf" target='blank'>Superheat: An R package for creating beautiful and extendable heatmaps for visualizing complex data</a>.<br><br>

STEMviz first displays the Google Sheet that supplies the data, using the R package <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/DT/" target='blank'>DT</a>, which is an R interface to the JavaScript <a href="https://datatables.net/" target='blank'>DataTables</a> library. You can interact with the data by using the tools provided by the DT package, including searching, pagination, sorting, and other table functions.<br><br>

The app then draws a heatmap using the quantitative variable selected by the user. The mapped variable can be changed using the drop-down list. When you choose a new variable the heatmap will be redrawn to reflect the change. The quantitative variables are as follows:<br><br>

<b>Week</b><br>
Week of course in which the topic first appears for at least 15 minutes of class time; first incomplete week is Week 1.<br><br>		
							
<b>Early/Middle/Late</b><br>	
  1	= Early: Before first midterm exam (first point of exam feedback).<br>				
	2	= Middle: After first midterm exam.<br>				
	3	= Late: After last midterm exam.<br><br>					
							
<b>Introduced/Reinforced</b><br>	
1 = Introduced:	Prior exposure is not assumed.<br>					
2 = Reinforced:	Prior exposure is assumed.<br><br>				
							
<b>Class time</b><br>	
Approximate number of class meetings devoted to coverage (in integers, rounding up for any fraction over a class period).<br><br>		

To produce the heatmap, the app creates a data matrix using courses as columns and topics as rows. Values of the matrix cells are supplied by the selected variable. Cells are color-coded according to their values, which are explained in an accompanying legend.<br><br>

NOTE: Cells that are colored white indicate missing data, caused by the fact that any given course does not contain the complete range of topics.<br><br>
